      <description>A common issue when starting a new project involving data is choosing a format in which to store the data.
The answer to the question of course depends on several aspects: the sources, the data types, the purpose, and its relational structure.
While modern approaches in Big Data endorse the strategy of first extracting high volumes of raw data and worry about processing later; in here we shall be concerned with the opposite case, when data has to be captured manually by a human team, and we don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend hours later trying to make it amenable for the computer to read.</description>

      <description>I sincerely hope that this Hugo website is&amp;ndash;finally&amp;ndash;the beginning of the blog I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching for a long time. Every year or so &amp;lsquo;I feel it&amp;rsquo;s time&amp;rsquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m am always detained by the boredom of the existing technology: neither I want to use log-in solutions such as Wordpress, nor I want to spend years writing html code, just to communicate a simple thought.
Knots and the name of this blog&amp;hellip; Before becoming a PhD student, I spent a some time thinking about geometry and knots.</description>
